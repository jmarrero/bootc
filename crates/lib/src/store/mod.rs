//! The [`Storage`] type holds references to three different types of
//! storage that together implement the unified storage model.
//!
//! # Planned three-store architecture
//!
//! The planned architecture for unified storage involves three content stores that
//! share physical disk blocks on a reflink-capable filesystem (XFS, btrfs):
//!
//! 1. **bootc-owned containers-storage** at `/sysroot/ostree/bootc/storage`
//!    (overlay driver) — the image is accessible to podman and shares layers
//!    with Logically Bound Images.
//! 2. **composefs object store** at `/sysroot/composefs/objects/`
//!    (SHA-512 content-addressed) — used by composefs-boot to mount the
//!    rootfs as EROFS.  Populated from containers-storage via `FICLONE`
//!    (`composefs_oci::pull` with `ZeroCopy`).
//! 3. **ostree bare repo** at `/sysroot/ostree/repo/objects/`
//!    (SHA-256 content-addressed) — provides deployment, rollback, fsck, and
//!    delta updates.  Populated from the composefs object store via `FICLONE`
//!    (`import_from_composefs_repo`).
//!
//! Each `FICLONE` ioctl lets the kernel mark source and destination extents as
//! copy-on-write siblings with no userspace data movement. On ext4 (no
//! reflinks), each step falls back to a byte copy.
//!
//! ## Implementation Plan
//!
//! The containers-storage → composefs step (arrow 1) is already implemented
//! for the composefs boot backend in `crates/lib/src/bootc_composefs/repo.rs`
//! via `pull_composefs_unified`.
//!
//! Wiring all three steps together for the ostree backend is the major planned work.
//! The composefs → ostree step (arrow 2) was proven by the `composefs-to-ostree`
//! spike branch. The planned implementation for the ostree backend will:
//!
//! 1. Perform a lazy cached probe (`reflinks_supported`) at install time.
//! 2. Pull into containers-storage first (Stage 1).
//! 3. Use `composefs_oci::pull` with `LocalFetchOpt::ZeroCopy` to populate composefs (Stage 2).
//! 4. Finally, synthesize the ostree commit by walking the composefs tree,
//!    reading metadata, computing SELinux labels, computing the ostree checksum,
//!    and `FICLONE`ing into the ostree bare repo (Stage 3).
//!
//! ## Long-term: Global composefs store
//!
//! The ultimate planned state (the "composefs-as-storage" plan) is to have podman's
//! composefs backend natively write objects to `/sysroot/composefs` directly, bypassing
//! even `containers-storage`. This would mean flatpak, podman, and bootc all share exactly
//! one global pool of content-addressed, deduplicated files.
//!
//! ## Why composefs in the middle
//!
//! The old unified storage path (containers-storage → skopeo tar → ostree)
//! serialized layers twice. composefs-ctl's `ZeroCopy` pull mode instead walks
//! the overlay `diff/` directories and FICLONEs each file into the composefs
//! object store keyed by SHA-512 fsverity digest — no tar involved.
//! See [container-libs#144](https://github.com/containers/container-libs/issues/144).
//!
//! ## Why reflink and not hardlink between composefs and ostree
//!
//! composefs is content-addressed by SHA-512 of raw bytes: two paths with
//! identical content share one composefs inode. ostree bare mode stores
//! uid/gid/mode/xattrs including `security.selinux` on each inode. Two files
//! with the same bytes but different SELinux labels produce different ostree
//! checksums but share one composefs object. One inode can hold only one
//! `security.selinux` value, so hardlinking would silently corrupt labels.
//! Reflink gives each ostree object its own inode while sharing disk extents.
//!
//! ## Reflink probe
//!
//! The reflink probe is performed lazily and cached. It creates
//! two anonymous temporary files (via `O_TMPFILE`, no
//! cleanup needed), writes one byte to the source, and attempts
//! `ioctl(FICLONE)`. Returns `true` on success, `false` on `EOPNOTSUPP` or
//! `EXDEV`. The probe directory is `composefs/objects` if it already exists,
//! otherwise the physical root itself.
//!
//! # OSTree
//!
//! The default backend for the bootable container store; this
//! lives in `/ostree` in the physical root.
//!
//! # containers-storage:
//!
//! Later, bootc gained support for Logically Bound Images.
//! On ostree systems this is a `containers-storage:` instance that
//! lives in `/ostree/bootc/storage`.  On composefs systems the
//! physical location is `/composefs/bootc/storage` with a compat
//! symlink at `ostree/bootc -> ../composefs/bootc`.
//!
//! # composefs
//!
//! This lives in `/composefs` in the physical root.
