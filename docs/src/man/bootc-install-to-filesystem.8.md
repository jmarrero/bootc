# NAME

bootc-install-to-filesystem - Install to an externally created
filesystem structure

# SYNOPSIS

**bootc install to-filesystem** \[*OPTIONS...*\] <*ROOT_PATH*>

# DESCRIPTION

Install to an externally created filesystem structure.

In this variant of installation, the root filesystem alongside any
necessary platform partitions (such as the EFI system partition) are
prepared and mounted by an external tool or script. The root filesystem
is currently expected to be empty by default.

Mount filesystems for `/var` or its subdirectories beneath *ROOT_PATH*
before invoking this command. On a fresh installation, bootc initializes
empty mounted trees from the image's initial `/var` contents, including
nested mounts. Empty `lost+found` directories and directories needed to reach
nested mountpoints do not prevent initialization. Within a tree being
initialized, mountpoints must resolve to directories in the image, not
symlinks. A mount for which the image has no content is left empty.
Filesystems that bootc initializes or leaves empty are SELinux labeled and
synced. Unlike the root filesystem, they are not remounted read-only.
When a tree includes nested filesystems, regular files are copied independently
instead of preserving hardlinks, which cannot span filesystems. Symbolic links,
ownership, permissions, and extended attributes are preserved.

If a mounted tree or any of its nested mounts already contains data, bootc
preserves that entire tree without merging image contents into it. Alongside
installations do not initialize external `/var` filesystems. This does not
change upgrade semantics: subsequent image updates do not update `/var`.
The caller remains responsible for configuring `/etc/fstab` or mount units
so the filesystems are mounted at the same locations on subsequent boots.

# OPTIONS

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED OPTIONS -->
**ROOT_PATH**

    Path to the mounted root filesystem

    This argument is required.

**--root-mount-spec**=*ROOT_MOUNT_SPEC*

    Source device specification for the root filesystem.  For example, `UUID=2e9f4241-229b-4202-8429-62d2302382e1`. If not provided, the UUID of the target filesystem will be used. This option is provided as some use cases might prefer to mount by a label instead via e.g. `LABEL=rootfs`

**--boot-mount-spec**=*BOOT_MOUNT_SPEC*

    Mount specification for the /boot filesystem

**--replace**=*REPLACE*

    Initialize the system in-place; at the moment, only one mode for this is implemented. In the future, it may also be supported to set up an explicit "dual boot" system

    Possible values:
    - wipe
    - alongside

**--acknowledge-destructive**

    If the target is the running system's root filesystem, this will skip any warnings

**--skip-finalize**

    The default mode is to "finalize" the target filesystem by invoking `fstrim` and similar operations, and finally mounting it readonly.  This option skips those operations.  It is then the responsibility of the invoking code to perform those operations

**--source-imgref**=*SOURCE_IMGREF*

    Install the system from an explicitly given source

**--target-transport**=*TARGET_TRANSPORT*

    The transport; e.g. oci, oci-archive, containers-storage.  Defaults to `registry`

    Default: registry

**--target-imgref**=*TARGET_IMGREF*

    Specify the image to fetch for subsequent updates

**--enforce-container-sigpolicy**

    This is the inverse of the previous `--target-no-signature-verification` (which is now a no-op).  Enabling this option enforces that `containers-policy.json` (see `man containers-policy.json` for the full search path) includes a default policy which requires signatures

**--run-fetch-check**

    Verify the image can be fetched from the bootc image. Updates may fail when the installation host is authenticated with the registry but the pull secret is not in the bootc image

**--skip-fetch-check**

    Verify the image can be fetched from the bootc image. Updates may fail when the installation host is authenticated with the registry but the pull secret is not in the bootc image

**--disable-selinux**

    Disable SELinux in the target (installed) system

**--karg**=*KARG*

    Add a kernel argument.  This option can be provided multiple times

**--karg-delete**=*KARG_DELETE*

    Remove a kernel argument.  This option can be provided multiple times

**--root-ssh-authorized-keys**=*ROOT_SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS*

    The path to an `authorized_keys` that will be injected into the `root` account

**--generic-image**

    Perform configuration changes suitable for a "generic" disk image. At the moment:

**--bound-images**=*BOUND_IMAGES*

    How should logically bound images be retrieved

    Possible values:
    - stored
    - skip
    - pull

    Default: stored

**--stateroot**=*STATEROOT*

    The stateroot name to use. Defaults to `default`

**--bootupd-skip-boot-uuid**

    Don't pass --write-uuid to bootupd during bootloader installation

**--bootloader**=*BOOTLOADER*

    The bootloader to use

    Possible values:
    - grub
    - grub-cc
    - systemd
    - none

**--composefs-backend**

    If true, composefs backend is used, else ostree backend is used

    Default: false

**--allow-missing-verity**

    Make fs-verity validation optional in case the filesystem doesn't support it

    Default: false

**--uki-addon**=*UKI_ADDON*

    Name of the UKI addons to install without the ".efi.addon" suffix. This option can be provided multiple times if multiple addons are to be installed
