#   summary: Test bootc loader-entries set-options-for-source on composefs
#   duration: 30m
#
# This test verifies source-tracked kernel argument management on composefs-
# booted systems. The composefs path directly modifies BLS entry files on
# /boot rather than staging a new ostree deployment. It covers:
# 1. Input validation (invalid/empty source names)
# 2. Adding source-tracked kargs and verifying they appear in /proc/cmdline
# 3. Source keys (x-options-source-*) in BLS entry files
# 4. Source replacement semantics (old kargs removed, new ones added)
# 5. Multiple sources coexisting independently
# 6. Source removal (--source without --options clears all owned kargs)
# 7. Idempotent operation (no changes when kargs already match)
# 8. Existing system kargs preserved through changes
#
# This test is composefs-specific. It exits 0 (skip) on ostree-booted systems.
# The UKI boot type is also skipped since kargs are embedded in the PE binary.
#
# See: https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/issues/899
